## App Configuration

### 1. Basic App Settings (app.json)

The \`app.json\` file is the main configuration file for your Expo/React Native app.

#### Update App Identity

\`\`\`json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",           // Display name
    "slug": "your-app-slug",            // URL-friendly name
    "version": "1.0.0",                 // App version
    "orientation": "portrait",          // Screen orientation
    "userInterfaceStyle": "automatic",  // Light/dark mode support

    "icon": "./src/assets/images/icon.png",  // App icon (1024x1024px)

    "splash": {
      "image": "./src/assets/book-here-splash-screen/4.jpg",
      "resizeMode": "cover",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

#### Update Bundle Identifiers

**For iOS:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourapp",
      "buildNumber": "1"
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

**For Android:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp",
      "versionCode": 1,
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./src/assets/images/icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF"
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Important:**
- Bundle identifier and package name must be unique (use your domain reversed)
- Format: \`com.yourcompany.appname\`
- Once published, cannot be changed
- Must match identifiers in Google Cloud Console and Apple Developer Account

#### Update App Scheme

\`\`\`json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "yourapp"  // Deep linking scheme
  }
}
\`\`\`

This enables deep linking: \`yourapp://screen/details\`

---

## Backend Integration

### 1. Configure API URL

Edit \`src/ApiUrl.js\`:

\`\`\`javascript
export default {
    api_url: "https://yourdomain.com/"
}
\`\`\`

  ** Important Notes:**
    - Must be HTTPS in production
      - Must end with trailing slash\`/\`
        - Should be your WordPress site URL
          - Test the URL in browser first

            ** Example:**
              \`\`\`javascript
// Development
api_url: "https://dev.bookhere.com/"

// Production
api_url: "https://bookhere.com/"
\`\`\`

### 2. Backend API Requirements

Your WordPress backend must have these endpoints:

#### Authentication Endpoints
  \`\`\`
POST /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token
POST /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token/validate
POST /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/user/register
\`\`\`

#### Property / Listing Endpoints
  \`\`\`
GET  /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/homey/search
GET  /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/listing/{id}
POST /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/listing/add
PUT  /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/listing/{id}
DELETE /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/listing/{id}
\`\`\`

#### Booking Endpoints
  \`\`\`
GET  /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/booking/list
POST /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/booking/create
PUT  /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/booking/{id}
\`\`\`

#### Message Endpoints
  \`\`\`
GET  /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/messages
POST /wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/messages/send
\`\`\`

### 3. CORS Configuration

If you encounter CORS errors, add to your WordPress \`wp-config.php\`:

\`\`\`php
// Enable CORS for mobile app
header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true');
\`\`\`

Or use a plugin like "WP CORS" for easier management.

### 4. Test Backend Connection

  \`\`\`bash
# Test API is accessible
curl https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/

# Test authentication endpoint
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"testpass"}'
\`\`\`

export default {
  common: {
    home: 'ホーム',
    search: '検索',
    favorites: 'お気に入り',
    profile: 'プロフィール',
    // ... more translations
  },
  auth: {
    login: 'ログイン',
    signup: '登録',
    // ... more translations
  },
};
\`\`\`

3. **Register language in i18n:**

## Styling Guide

### 1. Consistent Styling

Use a style system throughout:

\`\`\`typescript
// Good - Using constants
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: Layout.spacing.md,
    backgroundColor: Colors.light.background,
    borderRadius: Layout.radius.lg,
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: Typography.sizes.base,
    color: Colors.light.text,
    fontFamily: Typography.fonts.regular,
  },
});

// Avoid - Hardcoded values
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 16,
    backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
    borderRadius: 12,
  },
});
\`\`\`

### 2. Responsive Design

\`\`\`typescript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width } = Dimensions.get('window');
const isSmallDevice = width < 375;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    fontSize: isSmallDevice ? 14 : 16,
  },
});
\`\`\`

### 3. Platform-Specific Styles

\`\`\`typescript
import { Platform, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: {
        shadowColor: '#000',
        shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
        shadowOpacity: 0.1,
        shadowRadius: 8,
      },
      android: {
        elevation: 4,
      },
    }),
  },
});
\`\`\`

### 4. Dark Mode Support

\`\`\`typescript
import { useColorScheme } from 'react-native';
import { Colors } from '../constants/Colors';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const colors = Colors[colorScheme ?? 'light'];

  return (
    <View style= {{ backgroundColor: colors.background }}>
      <Text style={ { color: colors.text } }> Hello </Text>
    </View>
  );
};
\`\`\`

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization

\`\`\`
src /
├── screens /           # Full screens
├── components /        # Reusable components
├── navigation /        # Navigation setup
├── hooks /             # Custom hooks
├── helper /            # Utility functions
├── constants /         # Constants(colors, layout, etc.)
├── assets /            # Images, fonts
└── localization /      # Translations
\`\`\`

### 2. Component Structure

\`\`\`typescript
// 1. Imports
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { Colors, Layout, Typography } from '../constants';

// 2. Types/Interfaces
interface Props {
  title: string;
  onPress: () => void;
}

// 3. Component
export const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ title, onPress }) => {
  // Hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState();

  // Functions
  const handlePress = () => {
    onPress();
  };

  // Render
  return (
    <View style= { styles.container } >
    <Text>{ title } </Text>
    </View>
  );
};

// 4. Styles
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: Layout.spacing.md,
  },
});
\`\`\`

### 3. Performance Optimization

\`\`\`typescript
// Use React.memo for expensive components
export const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  return <View>{/* Complex rendering */ } </View>;
});

// Use useCallback for functions
const handlePress = useCallback(() => {
  // Function logic
}, [dependencies]);

// Use useMemo for expensive calculations
const processedData = useMemo(() => {
  return data.map(item => /* processing */);
}, [data]);
\`\`\`

### 4. Error Handling

\`\`\`typescript
try {
  const result = await apiCall();
  // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  Alert.alert('Error', 'Something went wrong');
  // Handle error gracefully
}
\`\`\`

### 5. Testing Changes

Always test on:
- [ ] iOS Simulator
- [ ] Android Emulator
- [ ] Physical iOS device
- [ ] Physical Android device
- [ ] Light mode
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Different screen sizes
- [ ] Different languages
- [ ] RTL languages (if applicable)

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables

**✅ DO:**
- Store all sensitive credentials in \`.env\` file
- Use \`.env.example\` as a template (no real credentials)
- Add \`.env\` to \`.gitignore\`
- Use different credentials for development/production
- Never commit \`.env\` to version control

**❌ DON'T:**
- Hardcode API keys in source code
- Share \`.env\` file publicly
- Include credentials in screenshots or documentation
- Commit API keys to Git
- Use production keys in development

**Example:**
\`\`\`env
# .env (never commit this)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_REAL_KEY

# .env.example (safe to commit)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
\`\`\`

---

### 2. API Keys Management

#### Google Maps API Key
- **Restrict** key usage in Google Cloud Console
- Add application restrictions (iOS bundle ID, Android package name)
- Add API restrictions (only enable needed APIs)
- Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console
- Rotate keys if exposed

#### Stripe Keys
- **Never** expose secret keys in client code
- Use publishable keys only in mobile app
- Process payments through your backend
- Use test mode keys for development
- Enable webhook signing

#### Other API Keys
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use separate keys for each environment
- Implement key rotation policy
- Monitor for unusual activity

---

## API Keys & Credentials

### What Should NEVER Be in Source Code

❌ API Keys and Secrets
❌ Database Credentials
❌ Payment Gateway Secret Keys
❌ OAuth Client Secrets
❌ Encryption Keys
❌ Private Keys (.p12, .p8, .pem)
❌ AWS/Cloud Credentials
❌ Firebase Admin SDK Keys

### What Can Be in Source Code

✅ Publishable API Keys (with restrictions)
✅ Public Configuration
✅ App Scheme/Bundle ID
✅ Non-sensitive URLs

---

## Data Protection

### 1. User Data Storage

**Local Storage (On Device):**
- Use \`expo-secure-store\` for sensitive data
- Never store passwords in plain text
- Encrypt user tokens
- Clear sensitive data on logout
- Don't cache sensitive API responses

**Example:**
\`\`\`typescript
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';

// Store securely
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('authToken', token);

// Retrieve
const token = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('authToken');

// Delete on logout
await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync('authToken');
\`\`\`

### 2. Network Security

**HTTPS Only:**
- All API calls must use HTTPS
- No HTTP in production
- Verify SSL certificates
- Use certificate pinning for extra security (advanced)

**API Communication:**
\`\`\`typescript
// ✅ Good
const API_URL = 'https://your-backend.com';

// ❌ Bad
const API_URL = 'http://your-backend.com';
\`\`\`

### 3. Authentication Tokens

**JWT Tokens:**
- Store in secure storage
- Include expiration
- Implement token refresh
- Clear on logout
- Validate on backend

**Biometric Auth:**
- Use as additional security layer
- Still require password as fallback
- Store biometric availability, not biometric data

---

## Common Security Issues

### 1. SQL Injection (Backend)
While this is a mobile app, ensure your WordPress backend:
- Uses prepared statements
- Sanitizes all inputs
- Validates data types
- Escapes output

### 2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Sanitize user inputs before displaying
- Use React's built-in XSS protection
- Don't use \`dangerouslySetInnerHTML\` unless necessary
- Validate URLs before opening

### 3. Insecure Data Storage
\`\`\`typescript
// ❌ Bad - AsyncStorage for sensitive data
await AsyncStorage.setItem('password', password);

// ✅ Good - SecureStore for sensitive data
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('authToken', token);
\`\`\`

### 4. Unencrypted Communication
\`\`\`typescript
// ❌ Bad
fetch('http://api.example.com/user/data')

// ✅ Good
fetch('https://api.example.com/user/data')
  \`\`\`

### 5. Insufficient Authentication
- Always validate tokens on backend
- Implement session timeout
- Use secure password requirements
- Enable 2FA where possible

---
